# 📚 Regression and Clustering Examples

This repository showcases a curated selection of machine learning projects, focusing on regression modeling, document clustering, and PCA-assisted clustering.

The projects are organized as follows:

## 📂 Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for regression and clustering analyses.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for each project.
- `src/`: Contains supporting Python modules and resources.
- `LICENSE`: License information.
- `README.md`: Repository overview (this file).

## 📖 Projects Overview

| Notebook | Description |
|:---|:---|
| 01_regression_models.ipynb | Implementation and evaluation of regression models, including handwritten Standard Linear Regression and regularized models (Ridge, LASSO, SGD). |
| 02_clustering_analysis.ipynb | Clustering of text documents using KMeans with custom cosine distance. Top term extraction and WordCloud visualization included. |
| 03_pca_image_clustering.ipynb | Clustering of tabular image data before and after dimensionality reduction using PCA. Comparison of clustering performance pre- and post-PCA. |

## 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated
